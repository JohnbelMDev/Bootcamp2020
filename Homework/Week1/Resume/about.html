  <h2>Software Engineer </h2>
  <span>The path to software engineer became a dream and a curiosity of why things are the way they and how to improve them. I’m a software engineer and I am here to help your dream</span>
  <h2> Freelance Photographer. </h2>
  <span> What motivated me to begin photography started with a sense of curiosity and that developed into a passion to help others see their beauty. Many times I’m inspired by the people that I take pictures of because seeing and hearing their
    excitement tells me that I am bringing joy in their lives, hence inspiring me to continue and make more art with my photography. I focus more towards portraits, with portraits brings a lot of possibility of capturing, seeing and connecting with
    more different people from different ethnicities. Advices I would give for anyone who wants to take photography seriously are to start reaching out to people, look for a popular social media and use that to your benefits, volunteer for events,
    weddings, school events, fundraising, volunteer at a company, visit your local libraries, and the most important lesson I learned while doing photography is reaching out people from different schools, university, staying local and get really
    involve within any community that you are involved with.
